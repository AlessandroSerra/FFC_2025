# FFC Tutoring Lessons Repository

Welcome to the University of Cagliari Tutoring Lessons repository. This repository is dedicated to storing code and materials created during tutoring sessions at the University of Cagliari. Whether you're a student looking to review concepts covered in sessions or an instructor seeking to share resources, you'll find everything you need right here.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to facilitate learning and collaboration among students and instructors at the University of Cagliari. It serves as a central location for storing code samples, exercises, projects, and other educational materials related to the tutoring sessions.

## Getting Started

If you're a student looking to access materials from a specific session, simply navigate to the corresponding directory and explore the contents. You'll find code examples, exercises, and any additional resources provided during the session.

Before looking up any lessons materials make sure you've setted up your Python Environment correctly. You can find an how-to-guide here [Setup_di_Python.pdf](Setup_di_Python.pdf).
